              In the beginning, it was about survival. I encounter so many men with rich, amazing, unbelievable stories to offer. I began to compile them—page after page of handwritten notes, scratched out in the low light of a cell. Every word was a reclamation of humanity in a place designed to strip it away.

              When I got out on bail, I spent countless hours manually typing those notes. It was a brutal grind before I realized that I could have had an app do it for me. It would have saved the bother, but the process taught me something vital:

              As I rewrote them for Substack, splitting stories into manageable chunks, I learned how to edit, how to introduce, and how to exit. I refined them within the Substack ecosystem, and by the time I was putting my book together, those refined digital versions had become something far more powerful than the original ink.
